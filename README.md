how to run code: node index.js

This is a simple Node.js application that sends an email to a specified user and tracks to check if the email was opened. 
The Nodemailer module was used. To install nodemailer you can run "npm install nodemailer". 

In the app, there are 2 APIs. One is for sending a "Hello" email to the user, and the other api is to show all the users that 
were used in the first API and the status of the email. The status can be either "email sent" or "opened". 

This app was deployed on Heroku: https://myndlift-send-email.herokuapp.com/
